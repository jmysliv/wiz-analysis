## How to download datasets

Datasets are too large to put them in the repository. However you can easily download them from this Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Gw6cbUBQeR87U47a3NgzBUpsGNDlmZlJ?usp=sharing

Then remember to place them inside `data` directory.
## Repo structure

 - `bin/main.py`: Code entry point
 - `conf/conf.py`: Configuration file for project
 - `data`: Directory for datasets
 - `outputs`: Directory for png files
